# An async generator object (whether native in 3.6+ or the pure-Python
# version implemented below) is basically an async function with some
# extra wrapping logic. As an async function, it can call other async
# functions, which will probably at some point call a function that uses
# 'yield' to send traps to the event loop. Async generators also need
# to be able to send values to the context in which the generator is
# being iterated, and it's awfully convenient to be able to do that
# using 'yield' too. To distinguish between these two streams of
# yielded objects, the traps intended for the event loop are yielded
# as-is, and the values intended for the context that's iterating the
# generator are wrapped in some wrapper object (YieldWrapper here, or
# an internal Python type called AsyncGenWrappedValue in the native
# async generator implementation) before being yielded.
# The __anext__(), asend(), and athrow() methods of an async generator
# iterate the underlying async function until a wrapped value is received,
# and any unwrapped values are passed through to the event loop.

# These functions are syntactically valid only on 3.6+, so we conditionally
# exec() the code defining them.

    # This sort of object type transmutation is categorically a Sketchy
    # Thing To Do, because the functions associated with the new type
    # (including tp_dealloc and so forth) will be operating on a

    # generator before we first iterate it, so ag_finalizer stays NULL
    # for the lifetime of the object, and we never have an object we
    # need to remember to drop our reference to.) We have a unit test
